          <h3 style="text-align: center;" > Stephen Hawking and ALS have been together for 55 years </h3>
          <h2 style="text-align: center;" > Recent Progress in ALS treatment and research in China </h2>
          <h3 style="text-align: center;" > Multi-field medical experts in Zhejiang Province comprehensive analysis of rare disease ALS </h3>
          The death of renowned British physicist Stephen Hawking yesterday has once again put the spotlight on a rare disease
          -- On ALS. ALS is medically known as "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease", commonly known as "ALS disease" in China.
          According to the American ALS Association, about 20 percent of people with ALS survive five to 10 years, 10 percent survive 10 to 20 years, and only 5 percent survive more than 20 years. As an ALS patient, Hawking was diagnosed from 21 years old to 76 years old, which is obviously a miracle from the clinical point of view, and this miracle is not accidental. Yesterday, The Times reporter interviewed the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, the Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, the field of neurology, the field of genetics, the field of rehabilitation of many experts in Zhejiang Tongde Hospital, and asked them to talk about the causes of ALS in simple terms, cases and the latest progress of current disease research.
          </p>
          <h3> There are specific reasons for surviving more than 50 years after diagnosis of ALS </h3>
          <p> "Suffering from this disease is very painful, more cruel than cancer," the medical community at home and abroad describes ALS. Because their sensory nerves are not violated, ALS patients watch with a clear mind as they gradually lose the ability to move, speak, and breathe. However, Hawking's survival of more than 50 years has given hope to the medical community, ALS patients and families. </p>
          Yin Xin, deputy chief physician of the Department of Neurology of the Second Hospital of Zhejiang Medicine, explained that from a congenital point of view, the physical conditions of each "ALS" patient have a fast and slow point of development of the course of disease, and Hawking belongs to the latter. In addition, nurture also plays a big role. First of all, due to Hawking's special international background, his cognition of ALS is much higher than that of ordinary people, so it was discovered early. Hawking is also an optimistic person, even during the illness, he never stopped a variety of social activities. Secondly, Hawking has not only been kept alive by the ventilator for a long time, but also received good nutrition and drug treatment, coupled with the careful care of his family members who are engaged in the nursing industry, these unique conditions are very helpful to extend his life. </P>
          <P> Yin Xinzhen's view has been recognized by the provincial Tongde Hospital neurology department chief physician Zhang epicenter. Zhang mentioned that in order to delay the life of ALS patients clinically, tracheotomy is generally done. Hawking had a tracheotomy at the beginning of his diagnosis in 1985, along with an implanted eye tracking device, which allowed him to maintain good communication with the outside world. This also makes his mental state is much better than the average ALS patients, and a positive mental state is extremely beneficial to the disease. </P>
          <h3> Many ALS patients in the province survive more than 10 years </h3>
          Yin Xinzhen introduced that the onset symptoms of ALS are different, mainly divided into limb onset type and medullary onset type. Limb onset can be manifested as early limb weakness, bulbar onset can be manifested as early swallowing, breathing difficulties, unclear speech. In either case, the disease progresses to respiratory failure and eventually to death. </p>
          <p> The team of Professor Wu Zhiying, vice president of the Second Hospital of Zhejiang Medicine, has studied ALS for many years, and 300 to 400 cases of ALS patients are diagnosed in the Second hospital of Zhejiang Medicine every year. As early as 8 years ago, when there was little understanding of ALS in China, Professor Wu Zhiying received ALS patients. The patient, who was only 11 years old at the time, initially showed symptoms of thinning of the jaws of his hands and weakness in holding a pen, and six months later progressed to walking stiffly. More than two years later, his speech became blurred and he had trouble swallowing.
          "We are constantly adjusting his treatment to slow the course of the disease, and although he is currently confined to a wheelchair, he can still eat slowly. As things stand, we expect him to survive for several more years." Wu Zhiying told reporters,
          Her department has seen another woman with ALS. The patient experienced a total of 15 years from diagnosis of ALS to death
          In the later stages of the disease, the patient underwent tracheotomy surgery due to breathing difficulties and was kept alive on a ventilator for up to eight years. Zhang said that many ALS patients are often misdiagnosed as suffering from cervical compression of nerves at an early stage
          Cervical spondylosis, so early diagnosis, early treatment, to prolong survival is very important. Wu Zhiying said: "From the clinical
          "On average, if patients are treated early, kept breathing on a ventilator, and professional care is provided, they can survive for more than 10 years."
          </p>
          <h3> Research on ALS has made progress in recent years </h3>
          <P> According to statistics, about 5% to 10% of ALS is familial inheritance, if someone in the family has been affected by ALS, it is necessary to do the corresponding genetic testing, so as to intervene in the next generation. </P>
          Wang Wei, head of the Genetic testing Center at the Provincial Tongde Hospital, said that according to a new study published online in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, on June 21, 2017, about 17 percent of ALS
          Cases may be caused by genetic mutations, while others may be linked to the patient's environment and autoimmune diseases, including heavy metal poisoning such as lead poisoning, which can cause neuronal disease. According to relevant surveys and studies, China's welders, pesticide producers and other high incidence, perhaps from one side to illustrate this point.
          </P>
          Just yesterday, Professor Wu Zhiying told reporters a good news, the second Zhejiang Medical Hospital is currently working with Zhejiang University to try to use artificial intelligence to solve the problems of life of patients with ALS. Perhaps in the near future, patients will be able to pass in large
          The chip installed in the brain connects to external devices to achieve self-care.

          <h3> Weibo hot reviews: </h3>
          <ol>
          <li> "The spirit of resisting America and aiding Korea should be engraved in the genes of every Chinese"
          <p> Rows of volunteer soldiers, lying prone on the minus 40℃ position, like "ice sculpture" group statues. Not long ago, the broadcast of the movie "Changjin Lake" aroused the spirit of anti-American aid to North Korea across the country, and many netizens even ate frozen hard potatoes to feel the feelings of the soldiers. Even if more than half a century has passed, the great patriotic spirit of resisting the United States and aiding Korea should not be forgotten, but should be engraved in the genes of every Chinese and continue deeply. </p>
          Not afraid of danger, not afraid of the enemy, go to the battlefield, every soldier against the United States aid North Korea is flowing with patriotism as the core of the national spirit, "even if it is frozen to death I will proudly stand on my position", it is such a patriotic spirit of death cast the victory of the anti-United States aid North Korea, to defend the infant China. There is no doubt that this is a great, tough, unyielding patriotism. </p>
           For such a bad act of some Western countries, we must re-arm ourselves with the powerful weapon of resisting the United States and aiding North Korea, internalize the patriotic spirit into the practical actions of everyone, and resist "aggression". </p>
          Therefore, as large as the whole country, all walks of life, and as small as every individual, we should carry forward the spirit of resisting the United States and aiding Korea. Specifically, the state should formulate relevant laws and regulations to promote and maintain the spirit of resisting the United States and aiding North Korea, such as taking corresponding punishment measures against individuals who blaspheme the soldiers of resisting the United States and aiding North Korea; All walks of life and relevant departments should organize more activities to commemorate the anti-American aid to the DPRK and carry out educational activities, so that the spirit of anti-American aid to the DPRK will become a common trend in the whole society. Every individual, no matter what identity and status they have, should always remember the spirit of resisting the United States and aiding Korea, deeply etched in their genes, and passed on for a long time. </p>

          "Don't let bureaucracy pollute the Student Union"
          On August 31, a video of "six student cadres" at Heilongjiang Vocational College checking their beds and posing for official power caused heated debate among netizens, with some netizens saying, "This scene scares the baby." The mere inspection of the bed, but like a gangland sweep, such a picture appears on the campus, it should not be. It is true that the student union in a university should not be "social," and should not be polluted by bureaucracy. </p>
          <p> In fact, looking at the major universities in China, the scandal like the Heilongjiang Vocational College student Union cadres sleeping is not an isolated case, and the bureaucratic style of the student union can be said to be long-standing. Previously, it was revealed that in the wechat group of a university student union in a certain place, a student called "chairman" as "senior" and was criticized. The "bureaucracy" in the student union is essentially the epitome of bureaucracy in society and officialdom. </p>
          Needless to say, where there are people, there is competition, and so is the student union. In order to run for the cadre of the student union, there are no small number of hidden operations that give gifts and benefits, after all, into the student Union, for their own interests, whether immediate or long-term interests, not without benefits. This virtually also encourages the arrogance of some students' cadres with vested interests, and even has a tendency to blur their identity, and they can't tell whether they are an "official" or a "student". </p>
          Once a bureaucratic style is formed, it will attract others to follow suit, and over time, a vicious circle. This kind of atmosphere, if not strictly checked, will only make some vested interests more brazen, so that the student union, a place that should shoulder more responsibilities, acquiesces in the "bureaucracy" such a hidden rule, and ultimately cold the hearts of good students. </p>
          <p> Therefore, colleges and universities should attach great importance to the common bureaucratic style of students' union, and strictly investigate and regulate the occurrence of such phenomena; For the cadres of the student union themselves, they should strengthen self-discipline and learn to self-examine and self-correct, whether in the school or into the society, the most important thing is to learn to be a man and return the school to a clean and positive environment. </p>
