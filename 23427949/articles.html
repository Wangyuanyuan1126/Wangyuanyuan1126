           <h2 style="text-align: center;" > Unemployed middle-aged people: the double test of life and psychology </h2>
           <p>In the hustle and bustle of the city, cars come and go, lights are bright, everything is running normally. However, there is a group of middle-aged people who are experiencing the silent impact of unemployment. Once, they were the dominant figures in the workplace and the breadwinners of their families. Now, due to the vicissitudes of the economic market, they are Mired in unemployment. Overnight, they met with professional failures.</p>
              <h2 style="text-align: center;" >From the elite to the lost </h2>
		   <p>Zhang Ziming, 42, a middle-aged man who used to work as a middle manager in a large enterprise in Hangzhou, lost his job last year due to poor management of the company. Now, he is a full-time homemaker.</p>
</br>Recalling the early days of unemployment, Zhang Ziming admitted that he had fallen into deep remorse and confusion, he said, "every month's high mortgage and car loans, I can't kick the gas." He felt he had lost his value and was filled with uncertainty and fear for the future. Graduating from a prestigious school, he never thought he would experience the distress of unemployment.
		
		</br>  
		   After losing his job, Zhang Ziming 's life changed dramatically. He began to take on the responsibility of taking the children to school, shopping for food and cooking. He revealed that he now has to re-plan his spending and cut back on non-essential items such as movies and other leisure activities. He began to get used to buying items on sale and saving money when he could.
		 </br>  
		   </br>In order to regain the direction of life, Zhang Ziming began to try various methods, hoping to regain the direction of life. He first participated in vocational training, hoping to enhance his job competitiveness by upgrading his skills. During the training process, he earnestly learned new knowledge, actively participated in discussions and practices, and constantly improved his professional quality. </br> 
	   </br>At the same time, Zhang Ziming also actively sought the help of friends. He asked friends for job search experience to understand the market needs and industry dynamics. On the recommendation of his friends, he sent out multiple resumes and participated in many interviews. Although he encountered many failures and setbacks in the process, he believed that he could stand up again.
	   </br> Although the days after unemployment are full of hardships, Zhang Ziming has always maintained an optimistic attitude. He knows that life will not always be easy, but he also believes that difficulties are only temporary. This, he told himself, was just a minor setback on the road to success. He believes that with his own efforts and persistence, he will be able to return to work as soon as possible.
		  </br> 
		 
		   <h2 style="text-align: center;" >From stable to uncertain </h2>
		   <p>
		    </br>Similar to Zhang Ziming's experience, Li Xin is also an unemployed middle-aged woman, 45 years old. She once worked as a product manager in an Internet company in Shenzhen. As a senior technician, she enjoyed a stable income and good welfare benefits. However, with a wave of layoffs in large factories, Li Xin finally failed to avoid the fate of layoffs. 
		     </br> 
		   After losing her job, Ms. Li faced unprecedented challenges. She not only has to deal with the financial pressure, but also face the psychological gap. The once familiar working environment and colleagues are now a distant memory.
		    </br> 
		   "After I lost my job, I tried to send out a lot of resumes, but I didn't get any replies, which made me feel very frustrated," she said.
		     </br> 
		   In order to support her family, Li Xin began to try various part-time and temporary jobs. She used her expertise to open a Taobao store and run an e-commerce business. Although the income is not stable, but can barely make ends meet.
		  </br> In fact, unemployment for Li Xin, the psychological blow is far more serious than the economic hardship. She often feels that she has lost direction and a sense of belonging, and is full of uncertainty and worry about the future. When night falls, she often sits alone at the window, gazing out at the world, full of worries. "To some extent, at my age, you've lost your age advantage in the job market." "She exclaimed.
		    </br> 
		   She admits that there was a time when she often wondered about the meaning of life and wondered if she would ever find a new direction and purpose. She was acutely aware of the impermanence of life. She understands that life will not always go according to her expectations, and for now, she can only try to face the reality.
		    </br> 
		   In the interview, Li Xin said that at this stage, she is actively adjusting her mentality, facing the plight of unemployment, she did not choose depression. Instead, she found a new way out by meeting more friends who were also unemployed, starting side businesses together. In addition to e-commerce, she is bold to try, involved in community group buying business, selling fresh food. She firmly believes that as long as you work hard, you will be able to regain that initial confidence. Li Xin's optimism infects the people around her, and her experience also encourages more people like her to bravely move forward in difficult situations.

 <h2 style="text-align: center;" >2. Brene Brown:  The power of vulnerability and the courage to face life</h2>
		   <img src="./img/图片1.jpg" alt=""style="width: 500px;display: block;;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		   "What makes you weak makes you stronger." Recently, renowned sociologist, author, and speaker Brene Brown shared her experience of bravely facing vulnerability and searching for real life in her TED talk, which has aroused wide social resonance. </br>
Brown, a leading expert on courage, shame, compassion and leadership, began her talk by challenging conventional wisdom about vulnerability. She believes that vulnerability is not a weakness, but an integral part of the human experience and has great potential to drive personal growth. </br>
By sharing her personal experience, Brown shows how to overcome personal weaknesses and turn them into motivation for self-growth. Embracing vulnerability, she stresses, doesn't mean giving in to failure or weakness; On the contrary, it is a courageous and honest step that can help us achieve personal development. </br>
Brown's call to cultivate compassion and understanding for oneself and others further moved the audience. She believes that when we are able to connect with our own and others' weaknesses, we are more likely to overcome shame, build deeper connections and co-create a more inclusive society. Brown has spent a long time in academia, and her TED talk on "The Power of Vulnerability" has been widely praised. In the speech, she recounted her shared experience with psychiatrist Diana, how she went through a year-long struggle and struggle to finally find the truth of life. </br>
She noted that in modern society, people often choose to avoid their own vulnerability and try to avoid suffering by paralyzing themselves. However, this kind of escape does not solve the problem, but may cause people to lose their sense of life and enthusiasm. Brown emphasized that we should not selectively numb our emotions, but should embrace our vulnerability, learn to be grateful and happy, love with all our hearts, and move forward even if there are no guarantees. </br>
Brown also spoke about the key role of education in fostering a culture of vulnerability, expressing concern that the education system for children places too much emphasis on grades and performance at the cost of children's emotional and mental health. She called on parents and educators to prioritize their children's emotional growth and development, encouraging them to accept their shortcomings and pursue authenticity. </br>
In addition, Brown urged businesses and individuals to demonstrate their vulnerability. She believes that it is only when we dare to give others a deeper understanding of our true selves that we can make truer, deeper connections and create a better world together. She further points out that such courage to demonstrate vulnerability not only helps individuals grow, but also drives social progress and change. By sharing our weaknesses and challenges, we can inspire compassion and understanding in others and foster empathy and cooperation between people. This open and inclusive attitude will help create a more understanding, supportive and caring social environment. </br>
Brene Brown 's TED Talk is a powerful reminder of the power of vulnerability and the courage it takes to face life. Her words encourage individuals and organizations to accept their own shortcomings and imperfections, learn from their mistakes, and become stronger.

“It's getting harder and harder to find a good job! Job hunting has been a challenging and exhausting process. For months, I’ve been sending out resumes, preparing for interviews, and enduring rejection after rejection. It feels like I’m constantly being thrown curveballs, and I’m just trying to keep my head above water. Each time I get a rejection email, it feels like a punch to the gut. I question what I’m doing wrong, why I can’t seem to land a job. I feel like I’m constantly pivoting, trying to adjust to the demands of the job market, but it’s just not working. I miss the stability and purpose I once had in my career. Remembering the days when I loved going to work, feeling accomplished at the end of each day. But now, it’s just a constant search for something that will give me that sense of fulfillment again. I miss the days when I used to find happiness with my friends after work, go to dinner, and sing songs, but now such days seem to be farther and farther away.  I hope that one day, I’ll find a job that not only pays the bills but also ignites my passion. Until then, I’ll keep persevering, dodging those dodgeballs, and looking for my next opportunity.”
